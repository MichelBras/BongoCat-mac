## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **📊 Stats Dashboard** - New Stats tab in the Hub showing activity charts, session history, streaks, and personal records
  - Bar chart of daily keystrokes with 7-day / 30-day range picker
  - Personal Records: best session keystrokes, best session clicks, longest session, most active day
  - Streak tracking: current streak and longest streak (consecutive days with activity)
  - Recent session history showing date, duration, keystroke count, and click count
  - Graceful degradation: aggregate totals shown when Supabase is not configured; sign-in prompt replaces chart

- **☁️ Backend Sync (Phase 1)** - Supabase-powered cloud sync for stats, sessions, and achievements
  - `BackendSyncManager` coordinates device registration, stats sync (30s debounce), session recording, and achievement upload
  - Stats are synced automatically while typing; pending syncs are flushed on app resign-active and recovered on next launch
  - Sessions are recorded at app launch/terminate; incomplete sessions from a crash are recovered on next launch
  - Achievements are uploaded instantly when unlocked
  - All sync is additive — the app works fully offline when credentials are not configured
- **🔑 User Accounts** - Sign in with Apple or email/password via Supabase Auth
  - Anonymous device data is automatically linked to the account on first sign-in
  - Sign out returns the app to anonymous mode; local data is never deleted
  - Account tab added to the Hub window (Achievements 🏆 → Account section)
  - Account status row added to Preferences → Advanced showing sync state and a "Sign In / Manage" button
- **🆔 DeviceIdentity** - Extracted persistent device ID into a shared `DeviceIdentity` utility used by analytics and backend sync
- **🌐 Network entitlements** - Added `com.apple.security.network.client` and Sign in with Apple entitlements
- **⚙️ Supabase config** - Credential loading from environment variables → `supabase-config.plist` → `Info.plist` (mirrors PostHog pattern); `supabase-config.plist.template` added; actual config file is gitignored

- **🖼️ Hub Window** - Added a new Achievements UI accessible from the menu bar ("Achievements 🏆")
  - Navigation sidebar with support for future sections (Skins, Stats, etc.)
  - Achievements container showing all milestones grouped by category (Keystrokes, Mouse Clicks, Total Activity)
  - Live stats header displaying current keystroke, click, and total action counts
  - Achievement cards with emoji icon, title, threshold, progress bar (locked) or checkmark (unlocked)
  - Unlocked achievements highlighted with accent color; locked ones shown with progress toward unlock
- **🏆 JSON-Driven Achievements System** - Replaced hardcoded milestone intervals with a flexible Achievement model loaded from `achievements.json`
  - 47 built-in achievements across keystroke, mouse click, and total activity milestones
  - Each achievement has its own id, type, title, icon, and message for rich notifications
  - Tracks notified achievements by ID in UserDefaults; migrates existing users' old-style tracking on first launch
  - Falls back to default thresholds if `achievements.json` is missing or invalid
  - Added "Send test" button in Preferences > Notifications for easy testing
- **🏷️ Floating Key Label Animation** - Each key press now spawns a floating label above the corresponding paw
  - Labels display the pressed key as symbols (↵ ⌫ ⎋ ␣ etc.), float 45px upward and fade out over 1 second with an easeOut animation
  - Multiple labels stack independently so rapid typing produces overlapping floaters
  - Mouse left/right clicks show "L" / "R" labels on the respective paw side
  - Labels are mirrored correctly when the cat is horizontally flipped
- **📊 Keystroke Counter Display** - Added a stroke counter label below the cat sprite in the overlay window
  - Overlay window height increased from 125px to 147px to accommodate the counter
